Amsterdam
=========

Introduction
============

Amsterdam is SELKS and Docker using Compose. The result of Amsterdam is a set of containers
providing a complete Suricata IDS/NSM ecosystem:

 - Suricata
 - Elasticsearch
 - Logstash
 - Kibana
 - Scirius
 - Evebox (https://github.com/jasonish/evebox)

The ELK stack is created using the official docker images. Communication between
logstash and suricata is done via a share directory (from the host). The same
applies to scirius and suricata where the `/etc/suricata/rules` directory is shared.

Installation
============

Generic
-------

You can install amsterdam from the source directory by running ::

 sudo python setup.py install

Or you can use pip to install latest released version ::

 sudo pip install amsterdam

Debian
------

You need to install Docker. On Debian ::

 sudo apt-get install docker.io docker-compose python-pip
 sudo pip install amsterdam

Ubuntu
------

On Ubuntu, you can run ::

 sudo apt-get install docker.io python-pip
 sudo pip install amsterdam

On Ubuntu 16.04 you need to export a variable to get docker and docker-compose in sync ::

 export COMPOSE_API_VERSION=1.18

Usage
=====

To sniff the `wlan0` interface and store data and config in the `ams` directory,
you can run ::
 
 amsterdam -d ams -i wlan0 setup
 amsterdam -d ams start

As of now the start command will take really long on first run as it will fetch from Docker hub
all the necessary images and build some custom containers.

Subsequent run should take less than 1 minute.

You can then connect to:

 - https://localhost/ on scirius with scirius/scirius as login/password 
 - https://localhost/kibana/ on kibana
 - https://localhost/evebox/ on evebox

The HTTPS server is accessible from outside so you can connect to IP or hostname from
there. So don't forget to change the default password.

To stop the amsterdam instance, run ::

 amsterdam -d ams stop

To remove an amsterdam instance in directory hacklu, run ::

 amsterdam -d ~/builds/amsterdam/hacklu/ rm

and remove the data directory if you want to delete data.

Updating
========

Updating amsterdam
------------------

For installation done via setup.py, you can just update the source code and
rerun the installation procedure ::

 git pull
 sudo python setup.py install

For installation done via pip, one can run ::

 pip install --upgrade --no-deps amsterdam

Updating an instance
--------------------

When code is updated (new suricata package or new ELK versions), you can run (supposing your
suricata listen on eth0) ::

 amsterdam -d ams -i eth0 update

Then, you can restart the services ::

 amsterdam -d ams restart

To do a complete update including Docker recipes and configuration files ::

 amsterdam -d ams -f -i eth0 update

Tuning and coding
=================

The configuration are stored in the config directory. For now only
scirius, logstash and suricata are configured that way.

Running Scirius from latest git
-------------------------------

To do so, simply edit docker-compose.yml in the data directory and uncomment and
set the path to the scirius source tree. You will also need to copy the local_settings.py
in config/scirius directory to in scirius subdirectory of your scirius source.

Once done, you can restart the services ::

 amsterdam -d ams restart

Run a migration inside the container ::

 docker exec ams_scirius_1 python /opt/selks/scirius/manage.py migrate

Backup
======
Backups in the scirius container are shared with the host. `/var/backups` directory is shared in `$basepath/backups` on the host.
 
To start a backup, run ::
 
 docker exec ams_scirius_1 python /opt/selks/scirius/manage.py scbackup
 
To restore a backup and erase all your data, you can run ::
 
 docker exec ams_scirius_1 python /opt/selks/scirius/manage.py screstore
 docker exec ams_scirius_1 python /opt/selks/scirius/manage.py migrate
 
This will restore the latest backup. To choose another backup, indicate a backup filename as first argument.
To get list of available backup, use ::
 
 docker exec ams_scirius_1 python /opt/selks/scirius/manage.py listbackups
 
You can not restore a backup to a scirius which is older than the one where the backup has been done.
